This paper uses independently collected data on pitchers in Major League Baseball (MLB) in
order to analyze trends in their production and reliability. The goal of this paper is to use different
predictors to create a logistic regression model that outputs the likelihood that a pitcher has
increased performance and/or increased usage (in the amount innings pitched). These predictions
will be based on the pitcherâ€™s statistics from the previous year. This paper investigates the logistic
regression model and the function used to create it. Specific topics covered include the range of
the function, parameters used in the function, and methods used for estimating these parameters.
The paper will briefly investigate a model creation method known as StepAIC, as well as the
influence of outlier data and collinearity. The effect that these have on the accuracy of the logistic
model will also be discussed. The paper will finish by discussing results. This will include the
accuracy of the model created, as well as comparing how accurate the logistic model is compared
to other predictive models.
